All ints.

if (x < 3 || y > 4) {
    statements1;
}
else if (x < 5 && y == 7) {
    statements2;
}
else {
    statements3;
}

--> is it possible for "statements2" to execute?


--> what if "y==7" becomes "y > 2"?

More with knights and knaves.

Knights: each full statement that they make is true
Knave: each full statement that they make is false



You see two different inhabitants, Ava and Bob.

Ava says that Bob is a knave.
Bob says, "Neither Ava nor I are knaves."

    "Ava is a knight and I am a knight"


What does "neither" mean? 


Rewrite both statements.
    Bob: Ava and I are both Knights


What are Ava and Bob?
    Suppose Ava is a knight:
        Then from her statement, Bob must be a knave. 
        This works, since Bob's statement 
        would be a Lie (he isn't a knight)

    Suppose Ava is a Knave:
        Then from her statement, Bob has to be a Knight.
        This doesn't work, because Bob's statement wouldn't  be
        true since Ava is a Knave, so this doesn't work.


Solution: Ava is a knight, Bob is a Knave.


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


You meet three inhabitants: Sarah, Bill and Mae.

Sarah tells you that only a knave would say that Bill is a knave.
Bill claims that it's false that Mae is a knave.
Mae tells you, "Bill would tell you that I am a knave."

What types are Sarah, Bill, and Mae?


(How might we simplify everything?)

Sarah: Bill is a Knight
Bill: Mae is a Knight
Mae: Bill says Mae is a Knave

Suppose that Sarah is a Knight: 
    From her statement, Bill must be a knight, and from his statement, Mae must also be a knight.
    Bill wouldnt not say Mae is a Knave, so this doesn't work.

Suppose that Sarah is a Knave: ************Similar HW problem*************
    From her statement, Bill must be a Knave, and from his statement, Mae must be a Knave.
    Bill would say that Mae is a Knight (lying), but Mae would lie and say Bill would say she was a Knave.
    This works.

Solution: all 3 are Knaves.

Lion always lies on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
Lion always tells the truth on other days.
Unicorn always lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays,
    and always tells the truth on other days.

On Sunday, everyone tells the truth.

Lion says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days."
Unicorn says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days, too."

What day is it?

Sunday: Doesn't work;
    Lion should tell the Truth and Saterday wasn't a lying day.

Tuesday: Doesn't work for Lion. Mon. was one of his lying days,
    but he should be lying about it. 
    Similarly, Wed/Fri/Sat also don't work

Monday: Works for lion, but unicorn shuold tell the truth
    so doesn't work.

Thursday: Works. Yesterday was oneof Lion's lying days and 
    Lion is telling the truth. Yesterday was not one of Unicorn's 
    lying days (and Unicorn is correctly lying about that)




////////////////////////////////

Tweedledee and Tweedledum are identical.
You know that one of them lies Mon/Tues/Wed,
and that the other lies Thurs/Fri/Sat.
(They tell the truth on non-lying days.)

(So they both tell the truth on Sunday.)

You don't know which is which.

You see both of them together.
The first one says: "I'm Tweedledum."
The second one says: "I'm Tweedledee."

Which is which? What day is it?

On every day but sunday, one would lie and one would tell the truth;
    in that case they would say the SAME NAME.

Solution: It must be Sunday.






//////////////////////////////////

In-class quiz

Monday: first twin: True. Second: True.



//////////////////////////////////

You know that either Tweedledum or Tweedledee has
    lost a rattle.
You find it, and want to return it to the correct one.
You don't know what day it is, but are sure that it isn’t
    Sunday.


(we know one is lying, one is telling truth)

The first one says: "Tweedledee owns the rattle."
The second one says: "I'm Tweedledee!"

Who gets the rattle?

Suppose first twin is telling truth, and second is lying:
    Tweedledee really does own the rattle. Second twin must be Tweedledum, and the first twin is
    Tweedledee. The first twin owns the rattle.

Suppose the first twin is the lyer and the second twin is telling the truth:
    Tweedledum owns the rattle and the second twin is Tweedledee. The First twin owns the rattle.

Solution: Rattle goes to the First twin (We still don't know who is who)



///////////////////////////////////////////

Based on Shakespeare's "Merchant of Venice".

There are three caskets – one gold, one silver,
    and one lead.
Exactly one of the caskets contains a portrait.
Each casket has a message on it, and you know that at most
    one of the messages is true.

Gold casket: "The portrait is in this casket."
Silver casket: "The portrait is not in this casket."
Lead casket: "The portrait is not in the gold casket."

Where is the portrait?

Cheryl's birthday problem.

Written for Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad in 2015

Albert and Bernard want to know when Cheryl's birthday is.
Cheryl gives them 10 potential dates:

May 15, May 16, May 19
June 17, June 18
July 14, July 16
August 14, August 15, August 17

Cheryl privately tells Albert her birthday month.
    (May, June, July, or August)

Cheryl privately tells Bernard her birthday day (number).
    (14-19)


Albert says: "I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is,
    but I know Bernard doesn't know too."

Bernard says: "At first I didn't know when Cheryl's
    birthday is, but now I do."

    (Bernard also knows it is not May or June)

Albert says: "Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is."

Answer: July 16th

///////////////////////////////////

Start truth tables and logic gates.

    have boolean variables
    want to express statements like: p AND (q OR r)

Variables can be true or false

Basic operations:

∧   and (&&)
∨   or (inclusive or) (||)
¬   not (!)
→   implies (if/then ->)


Basic logic gates (draw on board)
p->o NOT
pq =D- AND
pq =)D- OR

gates still used to design circuits


why do we care about equivalent circuits?
Costs more money

what about programming?
Easier to read

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

Fill in basic operations:


AND:

p q  #  p ∧ q
--------------
T T  #    T
T F  #    F
F T  #    F
F F  #    F


OR:

p q  #  p ∨ q
--------------
T T  #    T
T F  #    T
F T  #    T
F F  #    F


NOT:

p  # ¬p
--------
T  # F
F  # T

////////////////////////////////////////////////

IMPLIES operator →

"If I have a test, then I will study"

p: I have a test
q: I will study

p → q

It is false if we have BROKEN A PROMISE.
Otherwise we have not.

p q  #  p → q
--------------
T T  #    T
T F  #    F
F T  #    T
F F  #    T


/////////////////////////////////////////

How does the implies operator relate to programming?

    if statement

//////////////////////////////////////////

Design circuits for:

¬(p ∨ q)       (p NOR q)

¬(p ∧ (q ∨ r))

p XOR q (with just the gates we've seen, not a specific XOR gate)

(p \/ q)^!(p^q)

/////////////////////////////////////

How would we evaluate the output of these circuits with
different inputs?




Graphically build circuits:

https://logic.ly/demo/


//////////////////////////////////////

Evaluating logical statements.

Basic operations:

∧ - AND
∨ - OR (inclusive or)
¬ - NOT
→ - IMPLIES

////////////////////////////////////////

Consider ¬p ∨ q ∧ r.

--> what operation do we do first?



Order of operations

In math?

P E M D A S


For logic statements:

From highest (happens first) to lowest (happens last) precedence:


////////////////////////////////////////////////

Given this statement:

    ¬p ∨ q ∧ r

Add () to show the order of operations.




Evaluate the above statement using these
variable assignments:

p is T
q is F
r is F
