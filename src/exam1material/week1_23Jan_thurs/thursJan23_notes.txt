    be sure to explain your reasoning when asked
    on logic puzzles, should be clear why your answer is the only  
        one

All ints.

if (x < 3 || y > 4) {
    statements1;
}
else if (x < 5 && y == 7) {
    statements2;
}
else {
    statements3;
}

x < 3 || y > 4 would be false when:
    x >=3 and y <= 4

--> is it possible for "statements2" to execute? NO,
    because y would be <= 4 and can't also be equal to 7

More with knights and knaves.

knights: each full statement that they make is true
knave: each full statement must be false



You see two different inhabitants, Ava and Bob.

Ava says that Bob is a knave.
Bob says, "Neither Ava nor I are knaves."



What does "neither" mean?
    Bob: Ava and I are both knights


What are Ava and Bob?
    Suppose Ava is a knight. Then from her statement,
    Bob must be a knave. This works, since Bob's statement
        would be a lie (he isn't a knight).

    Suppose instead Ava is a knave. Then from her statement,
        Bob would be a knight. Bob's statement wouldn't be
        true since Ava is a knave, so this doesn't work.


Solution: Ava is a knight, Bob is a knave








////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


You meet three inhabitants: Sarah, Bill and Mae.

Sarah tells you that only a knave would say that Bill is a knave.
Bill claims that it's false that Mae is a knave.
Mae tells you, "Bill would tell you that I am a knave."

What types are Sarah, Bill, and Mae?


(How might we simplify everything?)

Sarah: Bill is a knight
Bill: Mae is a knight

Suppose that Sarah is a knight. From her statement, Bill must
    be a knight, and from his statement, Mae is must also be a knight.
    Bill would not say Mae is a knave, so this doesn't work.

Suppose instead that Sarah is a knave. From her statement, Bill
    must be a knave, and from his statement, Mae must be a knave.
    Bill would say Mae is a knight (lying), but Mae would lie
    and say Bill would say she was a knave. This works.

Solution: all 3 are knaves
    


////////////////////////////////////

Lion always lies on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
Lion always tells the truth on other days.
Unicorn always lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays,
    and always tells the truth on other days.

On Sunday, everyone tells the truth.

Lion says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days."
Unicorn says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days, too."

What day is it?

Sunday: doesn't work, Lion should tell the truth and Sat.
    wasn't a lying day for him.

Tuesday: doesn't work for Lion. Mon. was one of his lying days,
    but he should be lying about it. Similarly, Wed/Fri/Sat
    also don't work.

Monday: works for Lion, but Unicorn should tell the truth
    on Monday and Sunday wasn't one of his lying days.

Thursday: works. Yesterday was one of Lion's lying days 
    (and Lion is correctly telling the truth). Yesterday
    was not one of Unicorn's lying days (and Unicorn is correctly
    lying about that).





////////////////////////////////

Tweedledee and Tweedledum are identical.
You know that one of them lies Mon/Tues/Wed,
and that the other lies Thurs/Fri/Sat.
(They tell the truth on non-lying days.)

(So they both tell the truth on Sunday.)

You don't know which is which.

You see both of them together.
The first one says: "I'm Tweedledum." 
The second one says: "I'm Tweedledee."

Which is which? What day is it?

On every day but Sunday, one would lie and one would tell the
truth. They would give the SAME NAME on those days.

It must be Sunday. They are who they say.






//////////////////////////////////

In-class quiz





//////////////////////////////////

You know that either Tweedledum or Tweedledee has
    lost a rattle.
You find it, and want to return it to the correct one.
You don't know what day it is, but are sure that it isn’t
    Sunday.


(we know one is lying, one is telling truth)

The first one says: "Tweedledee owns the rattle."
The second one says: "I'm Tweedledee!"

Who gets the rattle?

Suppose first twin is telling the truth and the second twin is
lying. Then Tweedledee really does own the rattle. The second twin
must be Tweedledum, which means that the first twin is Tweedledee.
The first twin owns the rattle.

Suppose instead the first twin is lying and the second twin is
telling the truth. Then Tweedledum owns the rattle and the 
second twin is Tweedledee. The first twin owns the rattle.

(we still don't know who is who)


///////////////////////////////////////////

(skip - recommend practice)

Based on Shakespeare's "Merchant of Venice".

There are three caskets – one gold, one silver,
    and one lead.
Exactly one of the caskets contains a portrait.
Each casket has a message on it, and you know that at most
    one of the messages is true.

Gold casket: "The portrait is in this casket."
Silver casket: "The portrait is not in this casket."
Lead casket: "The portrait is not in the gold casket."

Where is the portrait?

Cheryl's birthday problem.

Written for Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad in 2015

Albert and Bernard want to know when Cheryl's birthday is.
Cheryl gives them 10 potential dates:

May 15, May 16, May 19
June 17, June 18
July 14, July 16
August 14, August 15, August 17

Cheryl privately tells Albert her birthday month.
    (May, June, July, or August)

Cheryl privately tells Bernard her birthday day (number).
    (14-19)


Albert says: "I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is,
    but I know Bernard doesn't know too."

Bernard says: "At first I didn't know when Cheryl's
    birthday is, but now I do."


Albert says: "Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is."


Solution:

Albert's first statement: can't be May/June, as those each have
a unique day (and Albert would know there was a possibility
that Bernard WOULD know).

Bernard's statement: can't be July 14/August 14, as Bernard still
wouldn't know answer.

Albert's second statement: must be July 16, as August still has
two remaining possibilities and Albert wouldn't be able to tell.


///////////////////////////////////

Start truth tables and logic gates.

    have boolean variables
    want to express statements like: p AND (q OR r)

Variables can be true or false

Basic operations:

∧   and (&&)
∨   or (inclusive or ||)
¬   not (!)
→   implies (if/then ->)


Basic logic gates (draw on board)


gates still used to design circuits


why do we care about equivalent circuits? less room, cheaper
    if one circuit is smaller


what about programming? more streamlined code


///////////////////////////////////////////////////

Fill in basic operations:


AND:

p q  #  p ∧ q
--------------
T T  #    T
T F  #    F
F T  #    F 
F F  #    F


OR:

p q  #  p ∨ q
--------------
T T  #    T
T F  #    T
F T  #    T
F F  #    F


NOT:

p  # ¬p
--------
T  # F
F  # T

////////////////////////////////////////////////

IMPLIES operator →

"If I have a test, then I will study"

p: I have a test
q: I will study

p → q

It is false if we have BROKEN A PROMISE.
Otherwise we have not.

p q  #  p → q
--------------
T T  #    T
T F  #    F  
F T  #    T
F F  #    T 

/////////////////////////////////////////

How does the implies operator relate to programming?

if statement

//////////////////////////////////////////

Design circuits for:

¬(p ∨ q)       (p NOR q)


p XOR q (with just the gates we've seen, not a specific XOR gate)

(this was done on the board during class)

/////////////////////////////////////

How would we evaluate the output of these circuits with
different inputs?

(this was done on the board during class)

<--------stopped here, will continue next week

//////////////////////////////////////

Evaluating logical statements.

Basic operations:

∧ - AND
∨ - OR (inclusive or)
¬ - NOT
→ - IMPLIES

////////////////////////////////////////

Consider ¬p ∨ q ∧ r.

--> what operation do we do first?



Order of operations

In math?




For logic statements:

From highest (happens first) to lowest (happens last) precedence:


////////////////////////////////////////////////

Given this statement:

    ¬p ∨ q ∧ r

Add () to show the order of operations.




Evaluate the above statement using these
variable assignments:

p is T
q is F
r is F
