Use mathematical induction to prove that the following expression:

    n(n+1)(n+5)
    
Is a multiple of 3 for all integers n>=1.

Base Case:
    We must show that n(n+1)(n+5) is a multiple of 3 when n = 1.
        We have: 1(1+1)(1+5) = 1*2*6 = 12, which is a multiple of 3

Inductive Step:
    We assume the inductive hypothesis -- that 
    k(k+1)(k+5) is a multiple of 3 where k >= 1.

    We must show that (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) is a multiple of 3.

    From our inductive hypothesis, we know k(k+1)(k+5) is a multiple of 3.
    We know either k is a multiple of 3, or k+1 is a multiple of 3, or k+5 is a multiple of 3.

    Consider each case:
        Suppose k is a multiple of 3. Then k+6 is also a multiple of 3, and so 
        (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) is also a multiple of 3.

        Suppose instead k+1 is a multiple of 3. Then (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) is also a multiple of 3.

        Suppose instead that k+5 is a multiple of 3. Then K+2 is also a multiple of 3, and so
        (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) is a multiple of 3

    Thus, (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) is a multiple of 3, since it was shown in each possible case.
