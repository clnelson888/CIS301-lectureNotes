////////////////////////////////////

What to do with preconditions and postconditions in practice?




--> why might this would be preferable to only using test cases?



See Java API

/////////////////////////////

Global invariants in practice.

--> write globalsAssert method to assert each global invariant

///////////////////////////////////////

See Java Account example (from Tues May 6 folder)

- recommend reviewing previous exams and practice exams

- final exam practice problems
    --> these don't include all possible problem types
    --> all topics include:
        - all topics listed for Exam 1
        - all topics listed for Exam 2
        - all topics listed for Exam 3
        - verifying programs with sequences
        - verifying programs with global variables and global invariants


(How to find list of topics from previous exams?)


//////////////////////////////////

Do sequence (#9), globals (#10), loop program (#7) first


<-- then in-class quiz



Continue practice problems
