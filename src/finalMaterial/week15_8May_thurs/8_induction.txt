Use mathematical induction to prove that the following expression:

    n(n+1)(n+5)
    
Is a multiple of 3 for all integers n>=1.


Base case. We must show that n(n+1)(n+5) is a multiple of 3 when n = 1.
We have: 1(1+1)(1+5) = 1*2*6 = 12, which is a multiple of 3.
The base case holds.



Inductive step. We assume the inductive hypothesis -- that 
k(k+1)(k+5) is a multiple of 3 where k >= 1.

We must show that (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) is multiple of 3.

From our inductive hypothesis, we know k(k+1)(k+5) is a multiple of 3.
We know either k is a multiple of 3 or k+1 is a multiple of 3 or 
k+5 is a multiple of 3.

Consider each case.

Case 1: Suppose k is a multiple of 3. Then k+6 is also a multiple of 3,
and so (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) is a multiple of 3.

Case 2: Suppose k+1 is a multiple of 3. Then (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) 
is also a multiple of 3.

Case 3: Suppose k+5 is a multiple of 3. Then k+2 is also a 
multiple of 3, and so (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) is a multiple of 3.


In each case, we showed that (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) is a multiple of 3.
The inductive step holds.


It follows from induction that n(n+1)(n+5) is a multiple of 3 
for all integers n>=1.
